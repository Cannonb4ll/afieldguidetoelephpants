# Elephant Field Guide

Everything you need to know about [elephpants](http://php.net/elephpant.php)
in the wild. With acknowledgment to Roger Tory Peterson.

## Viewing Locally

_A Field Guide To Elephpants_ uses [Sclupin](https://sculpin.io/) to generate
it's pages. Once installed, use `sclupin generate` to build the site. The
optional `--serve` flag will start a local web server. Due to the single-page
nature of the _Field Guide_, the `--generate` command may not work as expected.
