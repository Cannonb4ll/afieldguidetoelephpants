  separate pull requests.
* New content must have a verifiable source.
* By submitting a pull request you are agreeing to license your contribution by
  the same license as the rest of the guide (currently

## Style Guide

* Use spaces for indenting.
* Use Unix line endings (LF).
* Use a soft limit of 80 characters and a hard limit of 120 characters per line.

## Elephants

* Only "official" Elephpants are included.
* Elephpants are defined, one per file, in the `source/_elephpants` directory.
* The file name is of the structure `DATE-COLOR-IDENTIFIER.md`, where `DATE` is the
  date of public release, or public announcement (if earlier).
* Alternative animals are defined in `source/_other` following the same structure.

## Images

* As-of 2016-02-22, photos are stored locally from the `source/photos` directory.
* Photos should be cropped to 400 by 300 pixels.
* Preferably photos will link to a page with a full-resolution copy of the photo.
