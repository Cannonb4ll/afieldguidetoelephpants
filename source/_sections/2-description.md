#### Appearance

The typical elephpant stands 6" (15cm) tall, with ears that extend above its head,
and 8" (20cm) long including its frayed tail. The more rare “jumbo” variety stands
14" (26cm) tall and 20" (51cm) long. It is otherwise identical in appearance to the
smaller animals. Due to the larger resources needed to procure a jumbo variety,
and the increased space requirements for keeping one, they are considerably more rare.
Not all colors have been seen in the jumbo size.

The first populations of elephants seen in the wild were blue. This included both the
main species and the first few sub-species. Eventually other populations in have been
identified in most primary and secondary colors, and new colors are seen in the
wild on a increasingly frequent basis.

All elephpants have the PHP logo on the obverse (left) side.

#### Identification

Most elephpants can be identified by color and decoration alone. Sometimes identical
animals have been produced over multiple generations. The rear tag is the best
way of distinguishing between generations.

Sub-species of <em>{{ site.latinname }}</em> are generally identified by different
markings on the reverse (right) side. Within the subspecies there may be variations
of color.

#### Habitat

The elephpant's natural habitat is an work environment, and it is equally
comfortable in both “corporate” and “home” offices. They tend to form herds on
desks or shelves. Children and pets are often highly attracted to the animals.
While the elephpant does not mind the attention of these groups, it can be detrimental
to the animals' well-being and elephpant owners often keep the groups separated
for their protection, unless they have a large herd.

#### Distribution

There is no known limit the the elephpant's range. They have been sighted on multiple
continents and may be present in all areas of human habitation.
