#### Appearance

The typical elephpant stands 6" (15cm) tall, with ears that extend above its head,
and 8" (20cm) long including its frayed tail. The more rare “jumbo” variety stands
14" (26cm) tall and 20" (51cm) long. It is otherwise identical in appearance to the
smaller animals. Due to the larger resources needed to procure a jumbo variety,
and the increased space requirements for keeping one, they are considerably more rare.

Blue is the original and traditional color, but elephpants have been seen in most
primary and secondary colors, and new colors are appearing in the wild on a increasingly
frequent basis. Except as otherwise noted below, differences between colors are
largely cosmetic. All elephpant have the PHP logo on the obverse (left) side. The decoration
on the reverse (right) side varies by generation.

#### Habitat

The elephpant's natural habitat is an work environment, and it is equally
comfortable in both “corporate” and “home” offices. They tend to form herds on
desks or shelves. Children and pets are often highly attracted to the animals.
While the elephpant does not mind the attention of these groups, it can be detrimental
to the animals' well-being and elephpant owners often keep the groups separated
for their protection, unless they have a large herd.

#### Distribution

There is no known limit the the elephpant's range. They have been sighted on multiple
continents and may be present in all areas of human habitation.
