This animal has smaller ears than an elephpant, and tusks. The body of the
mammoth consists of both plush fur and longer hair.

The woolly mammoth is being produced for a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy),
and is not yet released. Original information specified that the mammoth would be
released without the traditional PHP logo on the obverse, but the sponsor now plans
to include the standard logo as well.
