This animal has smaller ears than an elephpant, and tusks. The body of the
mammoth consists of both plush fur and longer hair.

The woolly mammoth was produced as a giveaway at the [TrueNorth PHP Conference](http://truenorthphp.ca) 2015 in Toronto, Canada. A [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy) was held to help fund the giveaways.

Due to a production delay, the mammoths were not available in time for the conference which took place in November 2015, so the sponsor instead distributed the mammoths to TrueNorth PHP attendees primarily through meetups in and around Toronto. The mammoths were released and started shipping to Kickstarter backers in January 2016.

The mammoth was given its official name of Molly on February 14, 2016.
