This elePHPant was released in June 2016 by [OpenGoodies](http://open-goodies.com)
for [GLOBALIS](https://globalis-ms.com/). 
It will be delivered primarily to GLOBALIS team, partners, friends and customers.
Only 400 small and 5 big elePHPants were made.
About his name, Echo, it obviously refers to PHP.
But it is also a tribute to [Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(elephant)),
the famous elephant matriarch who was studied for over 30 years.
