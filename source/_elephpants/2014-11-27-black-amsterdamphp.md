This elephpant was produced via a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rdohms/the-amsterdamphp-elephpant).
The colors match the [AmsterdamPHP](http://amsterdamphp.nl/) logo, which in turn
match the flag and coat of arms of the City of Amsterdam.

The name MurPHPy was kindly given by the organizers of AmsterdamPHP after facing a multitude of troubles during the packing and shipping stages of the campaign.
