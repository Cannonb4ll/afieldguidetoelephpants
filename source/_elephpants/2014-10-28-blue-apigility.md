A true rarity. This elephpant was to be given away to attendees at ZendCon 2014. However, leading up to ZendCon there were many rocket attacks over Israel. Someone felt the elePHPant looked like it was launching a rocket, and it was decided that the possibility was too sensitive at the time. So the elePHPant with the Z-Ray goggles was created instead. - only the prototype exists.
