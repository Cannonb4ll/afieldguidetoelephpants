While included as an elephpant for the purposes of this field guide, this animal
is actually a woolly mammoth. It has smaller ears than an elephpant, and tusks.
The body of the mammoth consists of both plush fur and longer hair.

This color is being produced for a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy),
and is not yet released. Original information specified that the mammoth would be
released without the traditional PHP logo on the obverse, but the sponsor now plans
to include the standard logo as well.
